Rubik's Cube algorithm inverter
=======

I'm trying to learn Rubik's Cube "orient last layer" (OLL) algorithms.
See http://badmephisto.com/oll.php . I need a fast way to set up the
shapes that I want to practice on. First I tried to figure out which
algorithms, when applied to the solved OLL, will yield shapes I want
to practice (DOT Graphviz file). As it turns out, that's not a good
approach. So I just decided to invert the algorithms of the first 19
shapes I want to set up.
